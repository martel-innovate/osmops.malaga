Affordable5G Malaga Demo
------------------------
> Making OSM Ops do its bit in the Malaga 2022 demo.

This repo contains the files used to demo OSM Ops during the Nov
2022 round of validation for Affordable5G. OSM Ops takes part in
the shopping mall simulation where a child goes missing in a mall
and Affordable5G software helps security services find the child
by allocating 5G bandwidth to AI services that analyse mall videos
and other data to locate the child. So where does OSM Ops fit in?
OSM Ops deploys the service, code-named "Service X", that lets a
security guard trigger the software workflow that finds the child.
